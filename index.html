        <p class="cls1">I like to do some gardening in my free time. I do have a kitchen and rose garden, but I usually restrict myself to potted plants. It's a great way to refresh when you're surrounded by greenery. If it's a really exhausting day, I like to go out to my garden at noon and sit under the neem tree there, sometimes accompanied with my cats. Most of the stories and poems I write are also based on nature and its beauties. Planting and Gardening are also not only just a great way to relax and/or refresh, you also contribute to the environment. As you can tell, I love plants!ðŸŒ´ - Aaditri</p>
